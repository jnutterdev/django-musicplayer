### Django music player
A simple mp3 music player made with django and python. Project based off of the article from [Section](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-build-a-music-player-using-django/)

Would like to try and implement the following:
- Track seek feature
- List of file formats
- User upload feature (without using the admin panel)
